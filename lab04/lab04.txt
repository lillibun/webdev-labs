1. What is the value of SQLAlchemy?

SQLAlchemy is helpful because it allows for easy communication between databases and Python programs.
SQLAlchemy can essentially translate Python classes to tables for databases and makes it so that Python
function calls can be translated to SQL statements, essentially making it easier on the common programmer.
Overall SQLAlchemy makes it so that the user doesn't need to know lower-level SQL database instructions
and calls, and can instead use more higher level, Python language and methods. 
 
2. What is a model?

A model is a Python class that represents a database table. As seen in lab 4, the model is a data table
populated with certain types of data labels, read-only properties and the data itself. Overall, it is 
a python class, that defines structure for a database table. 

3. What is a view?

A view file is used to initialize routes ti certain APIS and is used to get information from
that certain view. For example, in the "following.py" view file the user is able to get the path,
as well as create a new "following" record, delete a "following" record, or return all of
a certain user's "following" records. Overall the view allows the user to interact with certain 
database tables using defined functions.
